## My process

- Firstly, I downloaded the required starting images and guides for the project.
- Then I initialised Git for version control.
- Created an HTML file to set the structure right
- Then i used CSS to style it
  - Went to get the link required to deploy the required font [outfit] on the webpage
  - Adjusted accordingly for the paragraphs using padding to look exactly like the design
  - Went an extra mile to include some footnotes of the challenge and creator
- Finally, i made the webpage responsive to some chosen screen sizes.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Git & Github [forVersionControl]

### What I learned

I learnt more practical ways to optimise and make the website responsive to different screen sizes from mobile to tabs to desktop view.

Some code snippets that I feel are noteworthy from this projects are:

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
  .container {
    height: 670px;
    width: 375px;

    padding: 5px;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 375px) and (max-width: 638px) {
  .container {
    width: 638px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I look forward to learning more on responsiveness and having my own personal full-stack developer website where people can get to know me as tho on a personal level.
